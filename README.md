# Bike Share Data Analysis

This project explores data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The analysis is performed using Python, numpy, and pandas libraries to import the data and compute descriptive statistics.

## Introduction

Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This project aims to analyze the bike share usage patterns using data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States.

## Statistics Computed

The project computes various descriptive statistics to uncover bike share usage patterns in Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The following information is provided:

### 1. Popular times of travel

- Most common month
- Most common day of the week
- Most common hour of the day

### 2. Popular stations and trips

- Most common start station
- Most common end station
- Most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

### 3. Trip duration

- Total travel time
- Average travel time

### 4. User info

- Counts of each user type
- Counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
- Earliest, most recent, and most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
